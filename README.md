# React - Pokemon

Practice using React components and properties.

## Requirements

Create a pokemon app that displays a group of 8 pokemon.

## Components

* App - render single Pokedex
* Pokecard - show a single Pokemon, and its name image and type.
* Pokedex - provided, via props, array of objects describing different pokrmon, and renders a series of Pokecard components.

```bash
# default pokemon object
{id: 1, name: 'Bulbasaur', type: 'grass', exp: 9}
```

## Further Study

* Fancier images - use alternate API for higher-res images.
* Pokegame component - random on page load, two different "hands" of 4 pokemon each. Shows winner and loser based off greater total "hand exp".
